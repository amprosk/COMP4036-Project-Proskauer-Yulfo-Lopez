## Welcome! This is Parsertongue a Python Programming Language

## Project Description
Parsertongue is a Python Programming Language that was created for a class project and may or may not be used for other purposes. We came up with the name after learning about parsers and to give it some character we added the word "tongue" simbolizing language.
### Functionality
For now, Parsertongue is a calculator that recognizes multivariable equations in the form of matrices. Later on it can be used for more bigger programming jobs. 
As the user inputs it's equation in standar form, Parsertongue can recognize the x, y, & z values. Let it be a 2x2 matrix or a 3x3 matrix, Parsertongue can efficiently output your variable values in just a click away.

> ### Important Note:
> Parsertongue cannot recognize empty values!!
> 
> Example: Say we have this equation 2x + z = 2
> 
> Parsertongue cannot identify if y is there or not, it will simply read each token as it would normally read it.
> 
> There is a simple & quick fix to that problem! 
> 
> When inputing an equation with an empty value, simply write '0' and the *empty* variable. 
> 
> Example: 2x + **0y** + z = 2.

***Now, in order for you to effectively enjoy using Parsertongue you must install a few things!
First things first, you must have your preferred **Python IDE** already downloaded to your computer. If not you can download one of the following: PyCharm, VisualStudioCode or Xcode (if you have MacOS). There are plenty of websites where you can also run python programming.***

### How to install Sly
Once you download your Python IDE, go to your computer or apps terminal and copy the following command line:
> `pip install sly` 

This will install sly's latest version (sly 0.4) onto your computer so you can get started using Parsertongue.
