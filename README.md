## Project Description
### Parsertongue
Parsertongue is a Python Programming Language that was created for a class project and may or may not be used for other purposes. We came up with the name after learning about parsers and to give it some character we added the word "tongue" simbolizing language.
### How to install
First things first, you must have your preferred Python IDE already downloaded to your computer. If not you can download one of the following: PyCharm, VisualStudioCode or Xcode (if you have MacOS). There are plenty of websites where you can also run python programming.

Once you download your python ide go to your computer or apps terminal and copy the following command line:
